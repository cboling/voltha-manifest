# voltha-manifest
REPO manifest files for specific versions of VOLTHA.

The OpenCord.org manifest project is used to track VOLTHA and CORD projects
but specifying a specific VOLTHA branch does not always work and pull down
the proper code.  This project attempts to do that and to prune the
number of projects retrieved.

Initially this will focus on the VOLTHA v1.6 branch but will hopefully track
other branches as well.
